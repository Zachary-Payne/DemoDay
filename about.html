   <h2>About Me</h2>


   <p>Hey my name is Zachary Payne and I am a resident of the Englewood community. I grew up in this area, although its not the most pleasant place i still look at it as home. In the summer of 2013, I received my first job from teamwork Englewood doing an internship with the 6th ward Aldermans office. I then received a position to take a class where I would be able to learn the language of coding from none other than englewood codes.It was a pleasure doing this program with Mr. Demond and Ms. melody! on top of all the fun I had I was also given the luxury of being paid to do it.</p>
